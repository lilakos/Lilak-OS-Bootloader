# Lilak-OS-Bootloader
A bootloader.
It's that simple.
Just a bootloader.






Oh, and it is worth noting a couple of things.
While this isn't an exposition of how I wrote my filesystem driver,
It is important to note that the DAP's will vary unless you do it
exactly like I did. In that case, have fun with a 1GB Disk image file.
I will post more information about my filesystem at a later date.
